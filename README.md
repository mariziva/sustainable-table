# SUSTAINABLE TABLE

# Because we all have zucchini rotting in our fridge.

## Description

Welcome to Sustainable Table, an app that allows you to inventory your perishable foods and gives you recipe suggestions to reduce your food waste. This web app is built with React and Rails and utilizes the incredible Spoonacular API.

## How to Use Sustainable Table
Fellow developers are more than welcome to peruse the code & fork/clone to replicate this project, but you'll need to obtain & use your own Spoonacular API key for the recipe return to work.

Users can view their foods, add/edit/delete foods in their inventory, view suggested recipes based on their foods, and add any of the suggested recipes to their meal plan.

## Future Updates
-Grocery list feature populated by the user's meal plan + current inventory
-Optimization of returned recipes
-Diet restrictions + cuisine preferences included
-Activity report of what percentage of food was used
-Recipes with easy substitutions are rendered (if you have lentils but not ground beef, a recipe using ground beef will still return)
-User dietary or palate goals to better inform recipe return
-Improved food and recipe display, including search and filter
-And so much more!

## Contact
I'd love your feedback on this project and welcome all questions and constructive criticism.

I am also actively seeking a role as a full-stack developer! I am based in Houston, TX and open to local and remote opportunities.
